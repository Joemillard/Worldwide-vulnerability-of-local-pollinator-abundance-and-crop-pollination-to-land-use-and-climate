# Introduction

Recent studies have highlighted rapid ongoing changes in insect biodiversity [@vanKlink2020; @Dornelas2019; @Lister2018]. Some of these studies have reported net declines [@vanKlink2020; @Lister2018], at least for terrestrial insects [@vanKlink2020], while others have shown mixtures of gains and losses [@Dornelas2019]. Pollinator biodiversity specifically has been shown to be undergoing rapid changes [@Biesmeijer2006; @Potts2010; @Oliver2015; @Powney2019; @Soroye2020], with potential consequences for the provision of pollination to wild plants and crops. Importantly, evidence for insect biodiversity trends has been biased toward Western Europe and North America, with little coverage of tropical regions [@Basset2019; @Wagner2020]. Although a few studies have shown steep declines of insects in the tropics [@Lister2018], evidence about insect biodiversity trends there often remains anecdotal [@Janzen2019], with global syntheses [@Dornelas2019; @vanKlink2020] having strong geographic biases towards non-tropical regions.

Among the drivers of insect and pollinator biodiversity changes, human land-use disturbance and climate change are prominent [@Potts2010; @Wagner2020]. A large number of studies have shown substantial effects of human land use and agricultural intensification on insects, including pollinators [@Warren2001; @DePalma2016; @Oliver2016; @Millard2021]. Climate change is emerging as an increasingly important driver of changes in insect biodiversity [@Warren2001; @Hickling2006; @Martay2017; @Soroye2020; @Lenoir2020; @Halsch2021]. Tropical insects are expected to be more susceptible to climate change, owing to their narrower physiological tolerance compared to non-tropical species [@Deutsch2008], but evidence about the response of tropical insects to climate change remains very scarce [@Halsch2021]. Evidence is now accumulating for strong interactive effects of land-use change and climate change on insects [@Suggitt2018; @Platts2019; @Oliver2017; @Peters2019; @OuthwaiteInPress]. A key mechanism underpinning this interactive effect is the altered microclimatic conditions in areas where vegetation has been modified for human land use [@Suggitt2018]. The interaction between the effects of climate change and land use is often synergistic, leading to greater declines in biodiversity than if the pressures acted alone [@Suggitt2018; @Oliver2017; @Peters2019; @OuthwaiteInPress], and larger declines in tropical than non-tropical insect biodiversity [@OuthwaiteInPress].

Changes in the biodiversity and composition of pollinator communities will have large effects on the provision of pollination services. Pollen limitation from animal pollinator losses has already been shown to reduce the reproductive success of wild plants [@Biesmeijer2006; @Rodger2021], and the productivity of certain crops [@Klein2003; @Ricketts2004; @Holzschuh2011; @Woodcock2019], although there is no evidence yet that pollen limitation is causing wholesale reductions in yields of crops that rely on animal pollination [@Aizen2008]. Evidence that insect biodiversity responds to human pressures more strongly in the tropics than elsewhere [@Millard2021; @OuthwaiteInPress] is noteworthy, given that the majority of animal-pollination-dependent crops are grown there [@Klein2007]. However, it is not only tropical countries that will experience the effects of pollinator losses and subsequent pollen limitation, with highly developed countries benefiting from imports of animal-pollination-dependent foods from tropical areas [@Silva2021]. Abundance, species diversity and functional diversity of pollinators have all been implicated as determinants of the delivery of pollination service [@Albrecht2012; @Brittain2013; @Genung2017; @Winfree2018; @Woodcock2019; @Dainese2019]. Previous attempts to model the provision of crop pollination service have been based on predictions of pollinator abundance, which bears a direct relation to pollination of plants, and has been shown to give a reasonable approximation of pollen deposition in at least some study systems [@Lonsdorf2009].

We present a global assessment of the interactive effects of climate change and land use on pollinator abundance, and predictions of the risk to crop pollination worldwide from the inferred changes in pollinator abundance. Our analyses are based on the PREDICTS database of biodiversity comparisons in different land uses [@Hudson2017], together with a list of species identified in the literature as likely pollinators [@Millard2021]. We use mixed-effects models to fit total pollinator community abundance as a function of land use (primary vegetation versus cropland) and a measure of historical climate change between a baseline period (XXXX-XXXX) and the X years prior to biodiversity sampling, standardized by monthly climate variability in the baseline period [@OuthwaiteInPress]. Using estimated proportional reduction of pollinator total abundance as a proxy for relative risk to pollination services, together with estimates of where crops are grown[@Monfreda2008], how dependent these crops are on animal pollination [@Klein2007], and projections of historical and future climate change, we predict which locations and crops are likely to be at greatest risk from pollination shortfalls. 

# Results and Discussion


![ Response of pollinating and non-pollinating insect total abundance to standardised temperature anomaly on primary vegetation and cropland (note that abundance is plotted on a loge scale). Both panels represent a linear mixed-effects model for pollinating or non-pollinating insects. Coloured lines represent mean fitted estimates for each interaction, and shading 95% confidence intervals around that prediction: green, primary vegetation; orange, cropland.](`r here::here("outputs/Figures/Final/Fig_1.png")`)

![Projected change in total production risk under an ensemble mean of two RCP scenarios (6.0 and 2.6) and a set of different abundance-production relationships, for both an index of change in risk and total pollination production risk. For each year into the future, the standardised temperature anomaly was projected globally for all cells of pollination-dependent production, using a 3-year rolling average. We used data on crop production from the year 2000 (the latest year when such data are available for all crops), therefore assuming that the distribution of the production of these crops does not change. For each annual projection of standardised temperature anomaly, insect pollinator abundance on cropland was predicted according to the model in Figure 1 (left panel), and then expressed as proportional abundance loss compared to cropland that has experienced no warming (i.e. standardised temperature anomaly of 0). In each cell, animal pollination-dependent production was then adjusted for the percentage reduction in abundance at that cell, before summing animal-pollination-dependent production for all cells at each time step. Line type refers to the shape of the abundance-production relatiionship: dashed, convex; and solid, linear. Colour refers to the degree of convexity of the relationship between abundance and production, with the highest level of convexity in yellow.](`r here::here("outputs/Figures/Final/Fig_2.png")`)

![Projected change in proportional production risk for 2050 under an ensemble mean of RCP scenario 6.0 and a linear relationship between abundance and production loss. Top left: Proportional production risk for the top 20 crops by pollination dependent production (see Figure S01 for the top 20 crops). Overall risk is the median of proportional production risk for all cells of that crop, whilst change in risk is the difference in overall risk between the start and the end of the series. Point size represents an estimation of the per kg value of each crop for the years 2015-2019, calculated from FAO data. Top right: Proportional production risk at the level of each spatial cell (see Figure S08 to see how  cell-level risk differs among abundance-production scenarios). Bottom: Proportional production risk at the level of each country. Here overall risk is the median of proportional production risk for all cells of that country, whilst change in risk is the difference in overall risk between the start and the end of the series. Point size here represents the total value of the pollination dependent production in that country (according to Monfreda et al 2008) adjusted for GDP.  Colour represents the geographic region of each country, distinguishing between regions within a panel: Blue, Africa; orange, Asia; black, Australia; green, Europe; yellow, North America; dark blue, South America; grey, the Caribbean.](`r here::here("outputs/Figures/Final/Fig_3.png")`)

![Projected change in import risk for 2050 under an ensemble mean of RCP scenario 6.0 and a linear relationship between abundance and production loss. Import risk is a measure of how the effects of localised production risk might be distributed among other countries, calculated using trade flow data from da Silva et al (2021). Left panel: Change in import risk betwen 2006 and 2050. Colours represent the degree of import risk change, from no change at 0 in yellow to a doubling at 1 in purple. Right panel: Total import risk in 2020 adjusted for population and then converted to a percentile. Colours represent each percentile grouping: yellow, 0-25th percentile; orange, 25-50th; purple, 50-75th; dark blue, 75-100th.](`r here::here("outputs/Figures/Final/Fig_4.png")`)
